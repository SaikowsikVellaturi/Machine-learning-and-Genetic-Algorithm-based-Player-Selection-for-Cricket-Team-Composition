Machine Learning and Genetic Algorithm-Based Cricket Team Composition

This project uses machine learning techniques, clustering, regression, and genetic algorithms to design an optimal cricket team composition. The dataset and techniques ensure a robust and data-driven approach to selecting players based on their performance and other criteria.

Features
Data Extraction:

Data is extracted from the web using the BeautifulSoup library to scrape cricket statistics and match details.
Includes scraping match results, player performance data, and other relevant statistics from ESPN Cricinfo and similar platforms.
Machine Learning Techniques:

K Means Clustering:Used for Eliminating Outliers 
Linear Regression: Analyzes player performance and predicts future outputs.
Genetic Algorithm:

Optimizes team composition by simulating evolutionary processes like selection, crossover, and mutation.
Ground-Specific Analysis:

Considers ground-specific data (e.g., Wankhede Stadium, Dubai International Stadium) for team selection tailored to specific conditions.
